# KWRBot
## Description
  This is bot written on .NET library for Discord.
  
  This bot is something that i've wanted to make and something that i won't probably finish.
  And this is also my "learning in progress" of how to work with git.
  
  Currently it has 2 commands: mention someone and join server.
## Road map
  1. Complete set of basic commands: ban, kick, move and so on.
  2. Complete handlers for critical situations
  3. Youtube playback from link
  4. Soundcloud hashtag search and playback

## Courtesy 
  Many thanks to Luigifan for providing library.
